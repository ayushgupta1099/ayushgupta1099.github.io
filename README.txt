The file AyushGupta.html is my personal potfolio website. Due to certain unavoidable situations I could not host it on GitHub.

//Important
To Open the html document, kindly open the folder in Visual Studio Code and start live server. I apologise for the trouble.
I have also included two of my projects for you to see which were supposed to be hosted along with the portfolio but could not be.

Unfortunately, due to time constraints and CT Pressure, the page couldn't be made responsive. 
So it is preferred to view it on a laptop/monitor.

I hope you like it and I'm open to criticism.


Regards,
Ayush Gupta
